Mosler is a monolithic slab-serif with 4 weights and 450 characters per style, making one of the most complete faces in the genre and style with small caps built-in and complete support for over 75 languages (not to mention some fancy word glyphs, a few select alternates, a heaping spoonful of mathematical and Greek symbols and much, much more).</p>\n\n<p>From the low contrast of the \"Safe\" weight to the extreme contrast of the \"Fortress\" weight, Mosler is effective in a wide array of applications but serves best as a titling, headlining, or display face that makes a mammoth statement. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.carmeltype.co/products/mosler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.carmeltype.co/products/mosler</a></p>\n\n<p>Not ready to buy? That's alright, we know it's only the first date. Don't leave empty handed though, we're offering one free weight of Mosler for the first 150 people who pay with a tweet.
