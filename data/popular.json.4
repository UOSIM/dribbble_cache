Mosler is a monolithic slab-serif with 4 weights and 450 characters per style, making one of the most complete faces in the genre and style with small caps built-in and complete support for over 75 languages (not to mention some fancy word glyphs, a few select alternates, a heaping spoonful of mathematical and Greek symbols and much, much more).</p>\n\n<p>From the low contrast of the \"Safe\" weight to the extreme contrast of the \"Fortress\" weight, Mosler is effective in a wide array of applications but serves best as a titling, headlining, or display face that makes a mammoth statement. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.carmeltype.co/products/mosler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.carmeltype.co/products/mosler</a></p>\n\n<p>Not ready to buy?
