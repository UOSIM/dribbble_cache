    "description": "<p>I had the honor of participating in Adobe's <em>Make it on Mobile</em> event this week at the Cooper Hewitt Design Museum in New York City. Adobe and Apple brought together a group of artists and designers to show the latest software for creating on the iPad Pro. Over the course of two days, we were tasked with designing a poster based on a phrase, which was printed out and presented at the end of the event.</p>\n\n<p>Mine ended up like a book cover from 1962, and I was ok with that. Adobe Capture proved great for turning my pencil and paper sketches into smoothed-out vector shapes. It's a pretty amazing tool.</p>\n\n<p>I learned an immense amount about utilizing the iPad as a creation tool—something I'd not done much of previously. The combination of the Apple Pencil, the iPad Pro and Adobe's software suite makes for quite the powerful combo. It's amazing to see where things are headed off the desktop. </p>\n\n<p>I believe more will be published from the event, including interviews with the other amazing artists (most of whom had never used an iPad in their workflow before, yet still created some incredible visual work).</p>\n\n<p>Here's to being creative in new and exciting ways.</p>",
