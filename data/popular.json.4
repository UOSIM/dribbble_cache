The process and work represents crossing into a realm of complete obliteration – a purgatory of haunting apparitions, arid landscapes, and unsettling ancient monuments of another time. Each piece was constructed with consideration of the environment it represents, using the elements of fire, dead wood, leather and hard steel. The visual story was created in an attempt to depict “the edge,” a notion written by the legendary author Hunter S. Thompson in his novel “Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs.” The characters throughout the story are within us - that feeling in your chest when you approach a level of dire insanity and acceleration you have never felt before. They are there, waiting for you. </p>\n\n<p>“THE EDGE... THERE IS NO HONEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO REALLY KNOW WHERE IT IS ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE GONE OVER.” - HUNTER S. THOMPSON Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs</p>",
