Doing this sort of experience design ahead of visual side can tend to be boring but I find it easier to sell the visual design better because there aren't that many surprises.</p>\n\n<p>Also, this wireframe only tells the visual part of the story. A ton of strategic thinking around storytelling went into this project long before wireframes even started.</p>\n\n<p>More to come!</p>\n\n<p>––\n<br />Looking for a design partner?

It's important for the brand to be carried strongly through the photography.</p>\n\n<p>We typically start with defining photography styles and test those styles alongside the brand elements. Once approved that framework narrows how we produce the images.</p>\n\n<p>Bravo to <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/136981\">@John Oates</a> for his handiwork on creating this brand, with <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/385539\">@Summer</a> Teal Simpson Hitch and <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/16711\">@Bill S Kenney</a> working alongside of him.</p>\n\n<p>_____________</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://focuslabllc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Our website</a> / <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/focuslabllc/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Instagram</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/focuslabllc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Twitter</a></p>",
