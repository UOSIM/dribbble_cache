About a week ago I came across an incredible project ICONSPEAK — t-shirts designed to ease the communication with locals wherever you go. The traveler’s t-shirt went viral with the speed of light, but what do we know about people that made this brilliant concept a reality? I felt obliged to right this injustice and talk to the masterminds that invented a t-shirt that has a potential to change traveling experience for everybody.</p>\n\n<p>Subscribe to get interview with creators of ICONSPEAK straight in your inbox tomorrow:\n<br /><a href=\"http://iconutopia.com/tomorrows-newsletter/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Interview: ICONSPEAK – Traveler t-shirt</a>\n</p>",
