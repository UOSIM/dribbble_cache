So to make up for lost time I figured I should make this the biggest one I've ever done.</p>\n\n<p>This building has been condemned for as long as I can remember and it stands out like a sore thumb in the neighborhood. So if it was already standing out why not make it a little interesting? I made this design for my wedding and I really wanted to use it out in the real world so I'm happy I found the perfect spot for it.</p>\n\n<p>You can check out some more details in the attachment.</p>",
