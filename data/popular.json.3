    "description": "<p>Here's a look at some early wireframes for Curbside's retailer site. There are a few schools of thought for wires and I tend to lean more high fidelity. Doing this sort of experience design ahead of visual side can tend to be boring but I find it easier to sell the visual design better because there aren't that many surprises.</p>\n\n<p>Also, this wireframe only tells the visual part of the story. A ton of strategic thinking around storytelling went into this project long before wireframes even started.</p>\n\n<p>More to come!</p>\n\n<p>––\n<br />Looking for a design partner?
